# qichachaCraw
<h3>This is a crawler for www.qichacha.com</h3>
<p>Project Background: I have a list of companies, but some of them are already out of business, and I need to search all these businesses on qichacha and pick out a list of companies that are still in business and then craw information about those companies</p>
<p>Because qichacha's defense is very powerful, so I think two ways to achieve : </p>
<ol>
	<li>Directly use selenium to complete the project, divided into two steps to verify and craw information</li>
	<li>Use selenium to log in, then save cookies and use requests to complete the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The second option is relatively faster but more complex, so I have not done it completely. But the first program I have completed and implemented in the project.</p>
